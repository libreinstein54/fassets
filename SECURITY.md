We actively maintain security updates for the following versions of our project. Please ensure you are using a supported version to receive critical patches.

Older versions that are no longer supported will not receive security updates. We strongly encourage upgrading to a maintained version to ensure continued protection.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in identifying vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Confidential Reporting**  
   Submit your report via our secure vulnerability disclosure form at **[insert link or email]**. Avoid publicly disclosing any vulnerabilities before an official fix is released.

2. **Acknowledgment & Assessment**  
   You will receive confirmation of your report within **[X timeframe]**, and our security team will begin evaluating the issue.

3. **Resolution & Communication**  
   - If accepted, we will work on a fix and keep you updated on our progress.  
   - If declined, we will provide reasoning and suggest alternative measures if applicable.  
   - Public disclosures will be coordinated to minimize risk while ensuring transparency.

Your collaboration helps us maintain a secure environment for all users. Thank you GitHubbers for  helping me contribute to the safety and integrity of our projects.
